# Summary

DITTO addresses a crucial task in 3D computer vision: the implicit 3D reconstruction from noisy and sparse point clouds. This network architecture significantly enhances 3D understanding ability by leveraging latent features in two modalities: grid and point latents. The core innovation lies in exploiting the synergy between these two types of latents. Grid latents, such as voxels or triplanes, are inherently robust to noise and useful for representing implicit fields, though they are somewhat detail-limited due to resolution constraints. Conversely, point latents, despite their inherent ambiguities, have the potential to capture much finer details due to fewer resolution limitations. Our contribution is in effectively integrating these two latent types within a network architecture, markedly improving 3D reconstruction performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our research holds significant potential for various applications involving implicit fields.
